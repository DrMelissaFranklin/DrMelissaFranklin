👋 **Hi, I’m Mel!**

Self-diagnosed "research addict" (seriously, who needs coffee when you’ve got data?). My brain is always hunting for the next insight, the next pattern, the next data set.  These days, I ask myself: why not use data science to improve human health and well-being?💡

👀 **What I'm up to**
I’m currently obsessed with applying machine learning, and the principles that drive all iterative processes, to human physical  --and even behavioral-- health. 💉  Whether it be the waxing and waning traits of a biological population (because that's what PhDs in evolutionary biology like me do), or playing with tradeoffs in the features of a dataset for a real-world problem, the paths forward are findable. 

💞 **Evolutionary Medicine: My Jam**  
Ever considered applying Darwinian principles to health? If not, you’re missing out. Check out this mind-blowing TED talk about how one veterinarian noticed a mismatch between modern environments and ancient physiology—across species—just like we see in humans! Spoiler: It may inspire a lifestyle rethink.

🌱 **Certified in Data Science (and Still Conquering)**  
This year, I have been personally coding  data science. I am seeking out ways to employdata empowerment skills for data structuring, automation and modeling (yep, you may have guessed it, I've been *python-ing* around 🐍). Python is a perfect foundation for using object-oriented code, including tools for big datasets like SQL, web scraping with NLP, and getting cozy with neural networks and cloud containers. It’s all a lot of techy goodness—and I’m loving every minute of this new direction for me! 💻

⚡ **Random Fun Facts**  
- To date, a few of the college courses I’ve most enjoyed teaching are pathophysiology, microbiology, and my individual seminars on evolutionary medicine (often considering tradeoffs within an organism), cancer biology (some tradeoffs  at the level of the cell), and preventing pandemics (down to some of the molecular tradeoffs).
    
- When I’m not geeking out over data, you might find me coordinating mindfulness or communication workshops for my peers. Because, hey, who says we can’t improve our own quality of life while studying it? 🧘‍♀️
